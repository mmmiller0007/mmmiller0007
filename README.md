👋 Hi, I’m Matt! 

I'm a Marine Corps Verteran. I have many interests and I do get distracted easily...in an enduring kind of way.*Hopefully😅* I hope to create and build things that will help the world be a better place. A free place. One driven by innovation and a pursuit for knowledge. Striving to be self reliant but also able to work together towards a shared dream. Propelling humanity into the cosmos. All the while, seeking to evolve the human spirit while also evolving technologically.☥


👀 I’m interested in:

Well honestly, a lot of different things! 
 
-I listen to music most of the time unless I'm really absorbed in something and am even feeling distracted by that! So with music I also like to dance. I prefer Hip-Hop, R&B and Latin music if I am going to dance. While I'm sitting down and working with computers, I prefer Lo-Fi and Vaporwave. I listen to pretty much anything. Just depends on the situation. As you can already gather.

-I do Photography, although it's been some time. But I will be getting back into it. Just have some other priorities at the moment.

I love video games! My favorites are RPG's, RTS's (would you count Chess as an RTS?) Racing, Fighting and FPS's. These are the main ones. Although, 
I am open to other ones. Legend of Zelda is for sure at the top of my all time favorites! I actually started my gaming experiences on the NES and playing titles such as: Mario, Duck Hunt and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I was hooked! However, my early home environment wasn't one of acceptance for my affinity for technology. Later this did change. I was given a computer that was scraped together by the IT guy at my fathers work! Now I had something that I could game on! I was finally weaving my way down the track in Need For Speed Hot Pursuit🏎! Battling through dragons playing Draken🤺! Shooting my way through hell😈 in DOOM and DOOM II 🔫🔫🔫! There were cheat codes🤖! Fully formed and fleshed-out games ready to be explored! I loved it! Thinking back, those were some of my fondest memories. A little time passes and a cousin of mine introduces me to Medal of Honor! LAN Parties! Staying up until wee hours of the morning blasting away at each other...Nostalgia...*sigh*. Needless to say that I still love gaming. 

-I do enjoy working with my hands and fixing things. If something breaks, I will learn how to fix it. Or sometimes I do break it more. Jk.That's one reason I enjoy building Gunpla. I want to get more into 

🌱 I’m currently learning:

-Obsidian
-BASH
-Linux as a whole right now.

🥅 Goals I'm hoping to achieve:

-Develop a Block-Chain to help the VA system be better run while keeping health data secure. I'm hoping that this will also allow for charity donations to be sent and managed using smart contracts. This way funds will have a transparent ledger and facilities will get all of the funds sent to them. If someone feels like helping a veteran, they can and don't have to do it while they're shopping using a middle man that they don't know how those funds are actually being spent or utilized. 

-Developing Apps. I have a few ideas but right now have to learn how the programs work, lol. 

-Getting more involved with the community and being part of creating and building tools. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:

-The above mentioned Block-Chain. I'm really in the dark on what I should do to even begin.
